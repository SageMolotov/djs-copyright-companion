## üéß What is DJ's Copyright Companion?

The **DJ's Copyright Companion** is an open-source, community-driven desktop application for DJs. It automatically scans your local music library, checks it against a community-sourced database of verified copyright information, and tags your tracks with their YouTube claim status.

Stop guessing which songs are safe for your mixes and start creating with confidence.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem It Solves

As a DJ, you spend hours creating the perfect mix, only to have it muted or blocked on YouTube due to a copyright claim. Manually testing every track is time-consuming and inefficient.

This application automates that process by leveraging a collective database of tracks that have already been tested by other DJs, saving you countless hours and preventing frustrating copyright issues.

- **Automated Scanning:** The application runs in the background and automatically detects new music added to your library.

- **Rekordbox Integration:** Automatically tags your tracks within your Rekordbox library, allowing you to create smart playlists based on a track's copyright status.
- **Simple Workflow:** Turns a tedious, manual task into a seamless, background process.
