### How to Contribute

There are several ways to get involved, even if you are not a developer.

#### **1. Submit a Test Result**

This is the most direct way to help the community. If you perform a manual "Test & Tag" on a track and get a result (safe, monetized, or blocked), you can submit your findings through the desktop application. This data populates the community database and helps everyone else.

#### **2. Report a Bug**

If you encounter a bug or an unexpected behavior, please let us know by opening a new issue on our GitHub repository.

* **Before Reporting:** Check the existing issues to see if the bug has already been reported.
* **How to Report:** Provide a clear title and a detailed description of the bug. Please include the steps to reproduce the issue and any relevant information about your environment (e.g., your operating system).

#### **3. Suggest a New Feature**

Have a great idea for how to improve the app? We would love to hear it! Open a new issue and use the "Feature Request" label. Please describe the feature and explain why you think it would be valuable.

#### **4. Contribute to the Codebase**

If you are a developer, we welcome your code contributions!

* **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the `djs-copyright-companion` repository to your own GitHub account.
* **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature-your-new-feature`.
* **Make Your Changes:** Write your code, following the existing style and adding comments where necessary.
* **Submit a Pull Request:** Once your changes are complete, push your branch to your fork and submit a Pull Request back to the main repository. In your PR, please describe your changes clearly and link to any related issues.
